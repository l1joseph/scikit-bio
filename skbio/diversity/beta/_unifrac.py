    """Compute unweighted UniFrac.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u_counts, v_counts: list, np.array
        Vectors of counts/abundances of taxa for two samples. Must be equal
        length.
    taxa : list, np.array
        Vector of taxon IDs corresponding to tip names in ``tree``. Must be the
        same length as ``u_counts`` and ``v_counts``. Required.
    tree : TreeNode
        Tree relating taxa. The set of tip names in the tree can be a superset
        of ``taxa``, but not a subset. Required.
    normalized : bool, optional
        If ``True`` (default), the unique branch length is normalized by the
        observed branch length, so the result falls in the range
        ``[0.0, 1.0]``. If ``False``, the raw unique branch length is
        returned.
    variance_adjust : bool, optional
        If ``True``, apply variance adjustment, downweighting the contribution
        of branches whose node counts across the two samples have high
        variance. Requires numba to be installed; raises ``ImportError``
        otherwise.
    validate: bool, optional
        If ``False``, validation of the input won't be performed. This step can
        be slow, so if validation is run elsewhere it can be disabled here.
        However, invalid input data can lead to invalid results or error
        messages that are hard to interpret, so this step should not be
        bypassed if you're not certain that your input data are valid. See
        :mod:`skbio.diversity` for the description of what validation entails
        so you can determine if you can safely disable validation.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The unweighted UniFrac distance between the two samples.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError, MissingNodeError, DuplicateNodeError
        If validation fails. Exact error will depend on what was invalid.

    Notes
    -----
    Unweighted UniFrac was originally described in [1]_. A discussion of
    unweighted (qualitative) versus weighted (quantitative) diversity metrics
    is presented in [2]_. Deeper mathematical discussions of this metric is
    presented in [3]_.

    If computing unweighted UniFrac for multiple pairs of samples, using
    ``skbio.diversity.beta_diversity`` will be much faster than calling this
    function individually on each sample.

    This implementation differs from that in PyCogent (and therefore QIIME
    versions less than 2.0.0) by imposing a few additional restrictions on the
    inputs. First, the input tree must be rooted. In PyCogent, if an unrooted
    tree was provided that had a single trifurcating node (a newick convention
    for unrooted trees) that node was considered the root of the tree. Next,
    all taxa must be tips in the tree. PyCogent would silently ignore taxa that
    were not present the tree. To reproduce UniFrac results from PyCogent with
    scikit-bio, ensure that your PyCogent UniFrac calculations are performed on
    a rooted tree and that all taxa are present in the tree.

    This implementation of unweighted UniFrac is the array-based implementation
    described in [4]_.

    If using large number of samples or a large tree, we advise using the
    optimized UniFrac library [5]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Assume we have the following abundance data for two samples, ``u`` and
    ``v``, represented as a pair of counts vectors. These counts represent the
    number of times specific Operational Taxonomic Units, or taxa, were
    observed in each of the samples.

    >>> u_counts = [1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0]
    >>> v_counts = [0, 1, 1, 6, 0, 1, 0, 0]

    Because UniFrac is a phylogenetic diversity metric, we need to know which
    taxon each count corresponds to, which we'll provide as ``taxa``.

    >>> taxa = ['U1', 'U2', 'U3', 'U4', 'U5', 'U6', 'U7', 'U8']

    We also need a phylogenetic tree that relates the taxa to one another.

    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> from skbio import TreeNode
    >>> tree = TreeNode.read(StringIO(
    ...                      '(((((U1:0.5,U2:0.5):0.5,U3:1.0):1.0):0.0,'
    ...                      '(U4:0.75,(U5:0.5,((U6:0.33,U7:0.62):0.5'
    ...                      ',U8:0.5):0.5):0.5):1.25):0.0)root;'))

    We can then compute the unweighted UniFrac distance between the samples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u_node_counts, v_node_counts : ndarray
        Vectors indicating presence (value greater than zero) and absence
        (value equal to zero) of nodes in two samples, `u` and `v`. Order is
        assumed to be the same as in `branch_lengths`.
    u_total_count, v_total_count : int
        The scalar sum of all tip counts in samples `u` and `v`,
        respectively.
    branch_lengths : ndarray
        Vector of branch lengths of all nodes (tips and internal nodes) in
        postorder representation of their tree.
    normalized : bool
        If ``True``, divide the numerator by the variance-adjusted branch
        length correction. If ``False``, return the raw numerator.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Variance-adjusted weighted UniFrac distance between samples.

    Notes
    -----
    The count vectors passed here correspond to all nodes in the tree, not
    just the tips. Unlike the plain weighted UniFrac formula, this sums
    directly over every node using the raw ``branch_lengths`` -- the
    tip-shortcut optimization used by ``_weighted_unifrac_normalized`` does
    not generalize to the variance-adjusted term, which is nonlinear in the
    node proportions.

        Computes the condensed pairwise unweighted UniFrac distance vector in a
        single parallel pass, replacing the O(n^2) SciPy ``pdist`` Python-callable
        dispatch. Parallelised over the first sample index ``i`` (``prange``); the
        inner ``j`` and node loops are sequential. Each ``(i, j)`` pair writes a
        unique condensed index, so there are no write races.

        Reproduces exactly the reference algorithm in ``_unweighted_unifrac``:
        for each pair, sum branch lengths of nodes present in exactly one sample
        (``unique``) and of nodes present in either sample (``observed``); when
        ``normalized`` is ``True`` the distance is ``unique / observed`` (or
        ``0.0`` when ``observed == 0``), otherwise the raw ``unique`` length is
        returned. When ``variance_adjust`` is ``True``, each node's branch
        length is additionally divided by ``sqrt(mi * (m - mi))``, where ``m``
        is the scalar sum of the two samples' tip-count totals and ``mi`` is
        the per-node sum of the two samples' counts at that node; nodes where
        that quantity is non-positive contribute zero.

        Sample ``i``'s node-presence row is computed once per ``i`` (outside the
        ``j`` loop) rather than recomputed for every ``j``, since it doesn't
        depend on ``j``; ``counts_by_node`` is expected to already be
        C-contiguous (the caller arranges this), so both that row and the inner

def _setup_multiple_weighted_unifrac(counts, taxa, tree, normalized, validate):
    r"""Create optimized pdist-compatible weighted UniFrac function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : 2D array_like of ints or floats
        Matrix containing count/abundance data where each row contains counts
        of observations in a given sample.
    taxa : list, np.array
        Vector of taxon IDs corresponding to tip names in ``tree``. Must be the
        same length as ``u_counts`` and ``v_counts``. These IDs do not need to
        be in tip order with respect to the tree.
    tree : TreeNode
        Tree relating taxa. The set of tip names in the tree can be a superset
        of ``taxa``, but not a subset.
    normalized : bool
        If ``True``, output will be normalized.
    validate: bool, optional
        If ``False``, validation of the input won't be performed.

    Returns
    -------
    function
        Optimized pairwise unweighted UniFrac calculator that can be passed
        to ``scipy.spatial.distance.pdist``.
    2D np.array of ints, floats
        Counts of all nodes in ``tree``.
