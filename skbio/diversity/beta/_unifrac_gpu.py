    NVIDIA support comes from the ``numba-cuda`` package, installable via
    scikit-bio's ``gpu-nvidia`` extra. AMD support requires ``numba-hip``,
    which is published only on test.pypi and must be pinned to match the
    installed ROCm version (for example
    ``numba-hip[rocm-7-0-0]==0.1.6`` for ROCm 7.0.0), so there is no
    single pip specification that works across ROCm releases and hence no
    ``gpu-amd`` extra. Note that ``hip-python`` alone is not sufficient: it
    provides low-level HIP bindings, not ``numba.hip``/``pose_as_cuda()``.
